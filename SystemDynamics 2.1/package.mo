<p><span style=\"color: #008000; font-size: large;\"><strong>System Dynamics</strong></span> is a modeling methodology designed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester</a> in the 1960s and 1970s for modeling and simulating mass and information flows of continuous-time systems in the soft sciences.</p>
<p>It is a low-level modeling methodology.  The software behind this library is not more complex than that behind the Block library.  Thus, the value of this library is not so much in the software modules themselves as it is in the application examples.</p>
<p><span style=\"color: #008000; font-size: large;\"><strong>System Dynamics</strong></span> is important, because this modeling methodology is widely used by researchers in the life and social sciences.</p>
<p>The methodology is built around the concepts of Levels and Rates.  <strong>Levels</strong> are quantities that can be accumulated, whereas <strong>Rates</strong> are the quantities that control the increase and/or decrease of the Levels.</p>
<p>Typical examples of Levels and Rates are given in the graph below:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig8.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>System Dynamics modelers are generally quite \"generous\" (sloppy) in the use of concepts.  This becomes clear when looking at the entries in the above table.</p>
<p>The Levels can be computed from the Rates by a simple differential equation:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig10.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>The Rates are being controlled by a so-called laundry list, a set of influencing factors that control the rates.  Below is a table that provides a possible laundry list for the human birth rate in a population dynamics study:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig9.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>There are usually many ways to model systems from soft sciences, i.e., different sets of variables constituting a laundry list may lead to quite similar simulation results in the end.</p>
<p>The Rates are usually determined by static non-linear functions of several variables, namely those listed in the laundry list:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig11.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>Since it is too complicated to identify such a complicated function of multiple arguments, the System Dynamics methodology usually simplifies the functional relationship by assuming a multiplicative relationship between the different input variables:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig12.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>The individual non-linear functions are now functions of a single argument.  They are usually identified from statistical information and are specified in the model as tabular functions.</p>
<p>A simple example of a System Dynamics model is shown below:</p>
<p><img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig7.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>
<p>This example describes the savings of a person.  The savings (a variable that can be accumulated, i.e., a Level) is controlled by income and expenses (Rate variables).  There are several categories of income (salary and interest), whereby the interest is proportional to the savings.  There are also several categories of expenses, namely bank fees, taxes, utility bills, and cost-of-living expenses.  The bank fees are also proportional to the savings.  If the parameters are set correctly, the modeler can observe whether his or her savings will grow over time, or whether they will get depleted.  Mass flows are represented by lilac connections, whereas information flows are depicted in blue.  The two lilac clouds represent sources and sinks of masses.  These are dummy models in our library.  They were only provided to maintain the look-and-feel of the System Dynamics methodology.</p>
<p>Originally, System Dynamics models were usually encoded in <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Dynamo</strong></span>, a very simple alphanumeric modeling/simulation language that was in fact already outdated (in comparison with other modeling/simulation environments) at the time it was created.</p>
<p>With the advent of the Macintosh computer in the mid-eighties, <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Dynamo</strong></span> was rapidly replaced by <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>STELLA</strong></span>, a graphical tool designed for representing System Dynamics models.</p>
<p>Although <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>STELLA</strong></span> offers a graphical user interface, the tool has its drawbacks.  It is still a very simple environment.  It is not truly hierarchical, and worst of all, it doesn't offer means for <em>documenting</em> models.  Yet documentation is very important, especially in soft sciences.  What precisely does a particular variable mean?  How is it measured?  What measurement units are being used?  For an electrical resistor or a mechanical inertia, the answer to these questions may be obvious, but this is not the case for many of the soft-science models.</p>
<p>The <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>SystemDynamics</strong></span> Modelica library offers some of the touch and feel of the <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>STELLA</strong></span> software, while providing the modeler with the full power and flexibility of the <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Modelica</strong></span> environment.  Integration of the <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>SystemDynamics</strong></span> Modelica library with other available <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Modelica</strong></span> libraries allows broadening the applications of the System Dynamics modeling paradigm to engineering domains. The multi-formalism and multi-domain capabilities of <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Modelica</strong></span> can be exploited to create models of complex and large socio-technical systems that have not been feasible using earlier implementations of the System Dynamics modeling methodology.

This is the oldest application area of System Dynamics.  In fact, the System Dynamics methodology had been originally invented by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester</a> to describe processes of factory automation. <p>

Although this is the original application of the methodology, it is not commonly used today for such purposes.  Most people nowadays prefer a different world view for the description of factory automation processes, namely that of a <font color=red><b>process-oriented discrete event simulation</b></font>, as this world view allows us to study better phenomena such as <font color=red><b>deadlock</b></font> and <font color=red><b>starvation</b></font> in a system. <p>

Typical tools for such purposes would include <font color=red><b>ARENA</b></font>, and there exists also a <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> implementation of that tool and modeling methodology, called the <font color=red><b>ARENALib</b></font>. <p>

<font color=red><b>Urban Dynamics</b></font> describes an application area that is located somewhere in between <font color=red><b>World Dynamics</b></font> and <font color=red><b>Industrial Dynamics</b></font>.  It includes application areas such as the studying of traffic flows in an inner city or along a freeway. <p>

Most people today prefer a different world view for the description of traffic flows in the inner city, namely that of a <font color=red><b>process-oriented discrete event simulation</b></font>, as this world view allows us to study better phenomena such as <font color=red><b>deadlock</b></font> and <font color=red><b>starvation</b></font> in a system. <p>

Yet, for the study of traffic flow along a freeway, the System Dynamics approach might still be the preferred way of dealing with such problems. <p>

Whereas the discrete event world view follows an individual car through the system from one traffic light and intersection to the next, the System Dynamics world view discusses the problem at a slightly more aggregated level using traffic volume as its levels and traffic densities as its rates. <p>

The <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> implementations of the two methodologies would allow us to intersect discrete-event traffic models of an urban area with System-Dynamics traffic models of its surroundings.  This application represents current research and has not much been tackled so far. <p>

One of the most important applications of the System Dynamics methodology are the set of world models that were developed primarily by the M.I.T. group around Profs. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Meadows\">Dennis Meadows</a>. <p>

Beside from the (meanwhile classical) world models, this view point would include models of climate dynamics, such as models of the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere; models of the melting of our glaciers accompanied by a rise of the waters of our seas; models of the spreading of pollutants through the atmosphere; models of the salination of our soil; and finally, models of the depletion of resources, such as sweet water for drinking and irrigation. <p>

This model describes the factory floor.  Goods under production are represented by the mass-flow model in the lower part of the graph, whereas incoming orders for these goods are represented by the mass-flow model in the upper-right part of the graph.  The signal-flow model represents the control of the production of new items based on the information obtained from the incoming orders.

This model describes the distribution network of produced goods.  Goods that are being distributed are represented by the mass-flow model in the lower part of the graph, whereas the orders for these goods are represented by the mass-flow models in the upper part of the graph.  The signal-flow model represents the control of the flow of goods based on the information obtained from their order status.

This model describes the retail of produced goods.  Goods that are being sold are represented by the mass-flow model in the lower part of the graph, whereas the orders for these goods are represented by the mass-flow models in the upper part of the graph.  The signal-flow model represents the control of the flow of goods based on the information obtained from their order status. <p>
 
The retail model is the same model as the distribution model except for the parameter values used.

<b>Customer Demand Modeled as Noise</b> <p>
 
Customer demand usually fluctuates in a random fashion.  Therefore, it is modeled in this simulation as normally distributed random noise with a mean value of <b>mean=1000</b> and a standard deviation of <b>stdev=100</b>. The noise is sampled once per week and kept constant for the corresponding week.  The order flow is modeled using the equation:<p>
<font color=red><b>RRR(t) = RRRini + normal(1000,100);</b></font> <p>
 
<hr> <p>
 
Simulate the model across 10 years (520 weeks), and plot on a single graph the incoming orders, the production flow in the factory, and the levels of goods in retail, distribution, and the factory as functions of time: <p>

<b>Seasonally Fluctuating Customer Demand</b> <p>
 
The third simulation involves seasonal fluctuation of customers with a capacity limit of 1200 items/week in the factory.  The customer demand remains always below the manufacturing capacity limit; nevertheless, the manufacturing site must operate at its capacity limit for certain time periods, while at other times, it runs at 20% of its capacity only. <p>

In Forrester (1961), a factory-distribution-retail inventory system is discussed in depth, modeled with the System Dynamics notation. At the time, the models had to be constructed using textual representations (<font color=red><b>Dynamo</b></font>). This very system is re-implemented here graphically using the <font color=red><b>SystemDynamics</b></font> library of <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font>, and the same simulations are carried out as are given in the book by Forrester. Effects of amplification, delays, and information feedback are demonstrated in the simulations. Among other things, it is shown, how small changes in retail sales can lead to large swings in factory production. <p>
 
The model is not introduced in detail at this place.  The interested reader is referred to Forrester (1961). Roughly, the system is divided into a retail, a distribution, and a factory part, each containing inventories for the goods (consumer goods, such as refrigerators, for example) and a corresponding logic for ordering or producing items to be sold to customers. The only input to the system is customer orders RRR (Requisitions Received at Retail), and the internal variables of the system (levels and rates) are to be investigated when customer demand fluctuates. <p>

This is yet another modification of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester's</a> <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model. We wish to introduce time reversal to the simulation.  To this end, we replace the regular continuous levels of the System Dynamics methodology by reversible levels. <p>

Simulate the model across 233 years with time reversal starting at year 200, i.e., we simulate the world model forward through time from the year 1900 until the year 2100, and then backward through time from the year 2100 until the year 2067.  For this experiment, you need to set the simulation accuracy to 1e-10. <p>
 
Plot the simulated world population against the calendar years. <p>
<img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig5.png\"> <p>
 
You shall notice that time reversal in the world model is numerically problematic.  The simulation is numerically unstable in backward direction.  The time-reversed model simulates correctly for a few years, but as numerical errors get the trajectory away from its designed path, the backward trajectory starts diverging quickly from the forward trajectory. <p>

Simulate the model six times across 200 years while keeping all six trajectories (plot setup menu).  For the six simulation runs, choose different levels of resource utilization after the year 1970: <br>
<font color=red><b>NRUN2 = {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5}</b></font>. <p>
 
Compute a performance index: <br>
<font color=red><b>Perf_Index = min_QL + 5*min_dPop;</b></font> <br>
where <b>min_QL</b> is the minimal quality of life observed between 2000 and 2100, and <b>min_dPop</b> is the largest negative population gradient observed in the same time period. <p>
 
Plot the performance index across the calendar years between 2000 and 2100 for all six scenarios on a single graph: <p>
<img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/SD_Fig6.png\"> <p>
 
<b>NRUN2 = 0.25</b> and <b>NRUN2 = 0.5</b> lead to massive die-off, whereas the other scenarios avoid this problem.  However in the short run, those scenarios that offer the worst long-term performance are characterized by the best short-term performance.

This model implements <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester's</a> <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model as described in his 1971 book on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/World-Dynamics-Jay-W-Forrester/dp/1883823382/ref=ed_oe_h/103-2487145-1208659\">World Dynamics</a>.  <p>
 
It is a very simply model that contains only five state variables: <br>
 
<ol>
<li>total human population,
<li>total persistent pollution,
<li>remaining non-recoverable natural resources,
<li>total capital investment, and
<li>fraction of capital investment allocated to the agricultural sector.
</ol> <p>
 
The aim of the model is to demonstrate, in very simple terms, that physical systems remain always constrained.  The production of goods (especially food) on this globe is limited by the available resources, and energy constraints will prevent production to grow indefinitely. <p>
 
While these are very simple facts, it is useful to investigate, when our globe will reach its limits.  Forrester showed that this will inevitably happen during the first half of the 21st century.  After that, humanity will invariably have to learn to transform itself from a society of (seemingly perpetual) exponential growth to one of (truly perpetual) stagnation, at least as long as humanity limits itself to the resources available on this one planet. <p>
 
Forrester listed his entire model in his book, which made it easy for other researcher to reproduce his results.  Many people have done so using a variety of different tools.  Whereas the original model had been coded in <font color=red><b>Dynamo</b></font>, a rather clumsy and old-fashioned alphanumerical M&S environment, the most popular tool for coding System Dynamics models today is <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font>. <p>
 
In this library, we offer a <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> implementation of Forrester's <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model. <p>

This model quantifies the land that is being used to produce food, i.e., the arable land.  The model contains three state variables, representing the potential arable land, i.e., land that could be developed to grow crop, but so far hasn't been developed; the arable land that is currently being used for agriculture; and finally, the land that is being used for urban development and industry (including mining).  Some of the potential arable land is getting developed over time, whereas some of the arable land is being lost either to urban development or to erosion. <p>
 
The arable land is measured in units of hectares.

This model describes the production of food.  Food is a controlled variable, as farmers decide what to grow and how much to grow on the basis of their perception of what they can sell.  Consequently, the model uses the perceived food ratio as a state variable.  If the farmers decide that too much food is being produced already, they'll produce less next year, and vice versa. <p>
 
A second state variable describes the capital that is being invested in growing food.  Since that capital (for example, the capital expended in buying food harvesting machines) cannot be allocated or freed instantaneously, it makes sense to maintain also that variable as a state variable. <p>
 
The agricultural input is measured in dollars/year, whereas the food ratio is dimensionless.

The <a href=\"http://www.footprintnetwork.org/gfn_sub.php?content=footprint_overview\">ecological footprint</a> is a concept developed by <a href=\"http://www.footprintnetwork.org/gfn_sub.php?content=whoweare\">Mathis Wackernagel</a> and his co-workers.  It attempts to quantify the percentage of the planet's carrying capacity being used up by humanity at any given point in time. Wackernagel showed that, since the 1980s, humanity is spending more resources per time unit than the planet can regenerate in a sustainable fashion. <p>
 
The human ecological footprint is measured in hectares per person.

This model calculates the capital invested in industry. <p>
 
Whereas the earlier <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model lumped all capital investment into a single state variable from which it then split off the percentage of capital invested in the agricultural sector as a second state variable (a funny choice for a state variable, since percentages don't accumulate), the more modern <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model differentiates between capital invested in industry, capital invested in the service sector, capital invested in agriculture, and other capital investment. <p>
 
The industrial capital is measured in U.S. dollars.

This model computes the land fertility as a function of its utilization.  Land can be overused.  If that happens, the fertility of the land shrinks.  This is likely to happen as the overall world population continues to climb. <p>
 
The land fertility is measured in kilograms of equivalent vegetable food per hectare and year.  Arable land can be used to either grow vegetable food directly, or alternatively, to raise animals that then enter the human food chain.  Yet it takes more land per human to raise animals than to grow vegetable food.  For this reason, it is meaningful to convert proteins obtained from eating meat to equivalent units of vegetable food. <p>
 
Notice that this model uses two different types of rate models.  Whereas the yield technology rate is a so-called bi-flow, i.e., it can assume both positive and negative values leading to a change of flow direction, the land fertility integrator uses uni-flows, i.e., flows that are allowed to flow in the indicated direction only.

This model describes the utilization of non-recoverable natural resources.  In the model (created in the early 1970s), the non-recoverable resources considered are mostly metals.  They are thus measured in metric tons. <p>
 
From today's perspective, it might make more sense to concentrate on the remaining fossil fuels, which is not the approach that Meadows and his coworkers took.  Yet, the effects of the dwindling resources on the overall economy are comparable, whether we can no longer produce goods, because we lack the raw materials or because we lack the energy to do so, results ultimately in the same predicament.  Due to the laws of exponential growth, we are running out of all kind of natural resources (fossil fuels, minerals, fresh water) almost simultaneously. <p>
 
In the case of minerals, recovery is partly possible, as discarded materials can be recycled.  However doing so requires energy for the re-concentration of these scrap materials.  The materials themselves don't get used up.  They only get dissipated further and further, until their density is so low that they cannot be collected any longer within reasonable cost limits. <p>
 
In the case of fossil fuels, these truly get used up.  These resources are non-recoverable within human time constants.  They were developed over many millions of years and essentially represent \"fossil sunshine.\"  Humanity is using all of these resources up within the very short time span (in geological terms) of a few hundred years.  <font color=red><b>Peak Oil</b></font>, i.e., the time when we shall have used up 50% of the available oil, and when supply can no longer keep up with demand, is now just around the corner. <p>
 
The fantastic recent developments of technology and the medical sciences, accompanied by an unprecedented growth of human population, would not have been possible without these resources, and won't be maintainable, once they shall have been used up. <p>
 
Whereas the earlier <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model only accounted for the dwindling resources themselves, the newer <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model offers a second state variable representing technological change.  Through more advanced technology, it is possible to use the available resources more efficiently, and that effect is accounted for by the second state variable in the model. <p>
 
In the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model, the natural resources themselves are measured in metric tons, whereas the technology change has no units.

This model describes the appearance of persistent pollutants.  These pollutants are an unwelcome yet inevitable byproduct of our industrial production.  Especially air pollution is problematic, because these pollutants are difficult to re-capture, and they remain in the air for a long time, somewhere in the order of 100 years.  These then lead to <font color=red><b>Global Warming</b></font>. <p>
 
Whereas the earlier <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model listed only the appearance and assimilation of pollution itself, the newer <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model accounts for the possibility of reducing the release of pollutants into the air by improved technology using a second state variable.  For example, it may be possible to burn coal in a power plant that captures the released CO<sub>2</sub> rather than releasing it into the atmosphere.  In this way, the greenhouse gas emissions could be significantly reduced, and thereby, the effects of global warming could be mitigated. <p>
 
Pollutants can take many forms.  For this reason, the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model normalizes the pollutants and expresses them in \"units of pollution.\"  In accordance with engineering practice, normalized quantities are assumed to be dimensionless (the dimensions are filtered out in the process of normalization), and consequently, pollution in this model is assumed dimensionless.  The technology change factor is also dimensionless.

This model describes the population dynamics of the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model.  Whereas the earlier <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model had lumped all of the population together into a single state variable, <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> offers a demographic model that distinguishes between four age groups, those of the children, those of the younger adults representing the child-bearing population, those of the older adults who are still in the work force, and finally, those of the retired population. <p>
 
Population is measured in numbers of living humans.  In accordance with engineering practice, which (arbitrarily) assigns measurement units only to real-valued quantities and not to integer-valued quantities, this model lists the population as dimensionless. <p>
 
This model is described on p.142 of <a href=\"http://www.pegasuscom.com/BookDetail.asp?BookQuery_Action=Find('ISBN','XDYGO')\">Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World</a>.

This model calculates the capital invested in the service sector. <p>
 
Whereas the earlier <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model lumped all capital investment into a single state variable from which it then split off the percentage of capital invested in the agricultural sector as a second state variable (a funny choice for a state variable, since percentages don't accumulate), the more modern <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model differentiates between capital invested in industry, capital invested in the service sector, capital invested in agriculture, and other capital investment. <p>
 
The service capital is measured in U.S. dollars.

Simulate the model from 1900 until 2100, and display the same variables as in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/193149858X\">Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</a> at page 169: <p>

The results obtained are not exactly the same as those shown in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/193149858X\">Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</a> due to the integration algorithm in use.  Most <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> simulation environments uses by default a variable-step / variable-order DASSL algorithm, whereas <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font>, just like the older <font color=red><b>Dynamo</b></font> software, uses by default a fixed-step Euler algorithm with a step size of 1 time unit. <p>
 
A second even more important difference is that my <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> code treats all variables as real-valued floating-point numbers, whereas the <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font> model treated some variables (e.g., population) as integers, whereas it treated other variables as fixed-point variables with only two significant digits after the comma.  This led to a quite noticeable quantization error. <p>
 
As I didn't see any good reason for unnecessarily mutilating the capabilities of the <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> simulation environment, I decided not to replicate these features of the <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font> code here. <p>

This is <font color=red><b>Scenario #2</b></font> of the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model. In the original scenario, industry stopped growing around 2040 due to an exhaustion of the remaining non-recoverable natural resources. <p>
 
In this modified scenario, the initially available non-recoverable natural resources are doubled to make them last longer.  This is a reasonable assumption, as indeed, the projections of available resources have repetitively been raised during recent decades.  Consequently, industry is able to grow unabatedly for 20 more years, before the increasing extraction cost finally puts a damper on its further growth.  Also postulated in this scenario are advances in resource extraction technology that make it cheaper and more efficient to produce the available resources. <p>

In order to accomplish this change, you need to modify the initial value of the natural resources as follows: <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real nr_resources_init(unit=\"ton\") = <b>2e12</b> \"Initial available non-recoverable resources\";</font>, <p>
you need to modify the table P_Fr_Cap_Al_Obt_Res_2 that describes the fraction of capital allocated to obtaining resources: <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real p_fr_cap_al_obt_res_2[:] = {1,<b>0.1</b>,<b>0.05</b>,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05} \"Non-renewable resource fraction remaining\";</font>, <p>
and finally, you need to reset one of the switching times in the model: <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real t_fcaor_time(unit=\"yr\") = <b>2002</b> \"Year of capital allocation to resource use efficiency\";</font>. <p>

This is <font color=red><b>Scenario #3</b></font> of the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model. This scenario starts out with the same assumptions as <font color=red><b>Scenario #2</b></font>.  In that scenario, the continued production of industrial goods caused the persistent pollution to accumulate.  That pollution led to a deterioration of the fertility of our agricultural lands, which caused a collapse over time. <p>
 
For this reason, it is postulated here that improved pollution control technology can curbe the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere by 4% starting in the year 2002.  The hope is that such a reduction can be reasonably well accomplished without suffocating the industry in the process.  In fact, our government already talk about measures that are considerably more stringent than just a 4% reduction in air pollution, although the already implemented measures have proven ineffective until now.  The greenhouse gas emissions are still growing essentially proportional with the industrial production. <p>

In order to accomplish this change, you need to modify the table P_PPoll_Tech_Chg_Mlt_POLGFM that models a multiplier to the generation of pollution as a function of available pollution technology: <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real p_ppoll_tech_chg_mlt[:] = {<b>-0.04</b>,<b>-0.04</b>,0,0} \"Persistent pollution technology change multiplier\";</font>, <p>
and you also you need to reset yet another one of the switching times in the model: <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real t_policy_year(unit=\"yr\") = <b>2002</b> \"Year of policy change\";</font>. <p>
The latter change has lots of consequences, as this policy control parameter appears in 16 different places in the model. <p>

This is <font color=red><b>Scenario #4</b></font> of the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model. This scenario starts out with the same assumptions as <font color=red><b>Scenario #3</b></font>.  Improvements in pollution control technology have led to an increase in the population. There are additional mouths to be fed, but unfortunately, not enough food is being grown to feed the population in the long run.  The population stagnates, and there is massive hunger in the world. <p>
 
In this new scenario, it is thus postulated that additional efforts are being undertaken to increase the yield of food per hectare of arable land. <p>

In order to accomplish this change, you need to modify the table P_Yield_Tech_Chg_Mlt_LYCM  that models a multiplier to the investment in technology to improve land yield: <p>

Simulate the model from 1900 until 2100, and display the same variables as in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/193149858X\">Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</a> at page 215: <p>

The results obtained are visibly different from those shown in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/193149858X\">Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</a> primarily due to the  quantization error. <p>
 
In this model, some of the gains are huge.  For example, the variable <b>agr_inp_per_hect</b>, i.e., the investment in agricultural production per hectare of arable land, that in earlier scenarios assumed values in the range <b>[2,30] dollars per hectare and year</b> suddenly assumes values of several <b>thousands of dollars per hectare and year</b>.  We observe hyperinflation at work. <p>
 
Due to the amplified quantization errors, the collapse happens more than 20 years earlier than shown in the book.  If we were to simulate beyond the year 2100, the results obtained using the <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> implementation could be considered similar to those obtained using <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font>.  The trajectories simply get shifted in time.  However, since we stop the simulation in 2100, our results look qualitatively different. <p>

This is <font color=red><b>Scenario #5</b></font> of the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model. This scenario starts out with the same assumptions as <font color=red><b>Scenario #4</b></font>.  Improvements in land yield enhancement have allowed more people to be fed a little while longer.  However, the effort is not sustainable.  The agricultural land loses its fertility rather quickly, and in the end, the collapse arrives even earlier than in <font color=red><b>Scenario #4</b></font>.  Humanity spends all of its money and more in trying to grow more food at all cost.  This leads to rampant hyperinflation. <p>
 
In this new scenario, it is thus postulated to spend more money earlier on for the protection of the arable land against erosion. <p>

This is <font color=red><b>Scenario #6</b></font> of the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model. This scenario starts out with the same assumptions as <font color=red><b>Scenario #5</b></font>.  Land erosion protection has indeed helped.  Yet more people can live on this planet for yet more years.  In the end, however, we are once again running out of natural resources. <p>
 
In this new scenario, it is thus postulated to spend more money on increasing the efficiency of use of the remaining natural resources. <p>

Simulate the model from 1900 until 2100, and display the same variables as in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/193149858X\">Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</a> at page 219: <p>

This seems to have done the trick.  The population no longer declines during the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  Is this effort sustainable? <p>
 
To answer this question, let us simulate the model once more, this time from 1900 until 2500: <p>

The effort is indeed sustainable.  The world population hovers around 10 billion people.  Yet, these people live very poorly.  In the end, no money is left for industrial production and/or services.  All of the human efforts are spent on feeding the world population in a sustainable fashion.  The life expectancy is back at its pre-industrial value of 27.6 years. <p>
 
No generation before ours lived as long and as prosperous as we do, and the likelihood is large that none coming after us will do so either. <p>

This is <font color=red><b>Scenario #7</b></font> of the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model. This scenario starts out with the same assumptions as <font color=red><b>Scenario #2</b></font>. <p>
 
We now want to try out another approach.  Instead of improving the means of production, we shall attempt strict birth control.  Every family is limited to two children only.  Due to the age structure momentum, the population keeps growing for another generation.  Then it will finally start on its path of natural attrition. <p>

In order to accomplish this change, you need to reset two of the switching times in the model: <p>

This is <font color=red><b>Scenario #8</b></font> of the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model. This scenario starts out with the same assumptions as <font color=red><b>Scenario #7</b></font>.  Birth control allowed the industrial output to grow a bit faster, but ultimately, it got stopped by the increasing cost of controlling pollution. <p>
 
We now want to control the industrial output.  Furthermore, we want to give the capital investment a 25% increased life time. <p>

In order to accomplish this change, you need to reset two of the modify a number of parameters in the model: <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real ind_out_pc_des(unit=\"dollar/yr\") = <b>350</b> \"Desired annual industrial per capita output\";</font>. <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real p_avg_life_agr_inp_2(unit=\"yr\") = <b>2.5</b> \"Controlled average life of agricultural input\";</font>. <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real p_avg_life_ind_cap_2(unit=\"yr\") = <b>18</b> \"Controlled average life of industrial capital\";</font>. <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real p_avg_life_serv_cap_2(unit=\"yr\") = <b>25</b> \"Controlled average life of service sector capital\";</font>. <p>
 
Finally, we need to reset two more of the switching times in the model: <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real t_ind_equil_time(unit=\"yr\") = <b>2002</b> \"Year of industrial equilibrium\";</font>. <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real t_policy_year(unit=\"yr\") = <b>2002</b> \"Year of policy change\";</font>. <p>

Control of the industrial output helped to guarantee a relatively high standard of living for a while longer.  Yet, the stressors discussed before finally drag the system down. <p>

In order to accomplish this change, you need to modify the three tables as done earlier: <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real p_ppoll_tech_chg_mlt[:] = {<b>-0.04</b>,<b>-0.04</b>,0,0} \"Persistent pollution technology change multiplier\";</font>, <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real p_res_tech_chg_mlt[:] = {<b>-0.04</b>,<b>-0.04</b>,0,0} \"Resource technology change multiplier\";</font>. <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real p_yield_tech_chg_mlt[:] = {0,0,<b>0.04</b>,<b>0.04</b>} \"Yield technology change multiplier\";</font>. <p>
 
We also need to reset one more of the switching times in the model: <p>
<font color=red>parameter Real t_land_life_time(unit=\"yr\") = <b>2002</b> \"Land life time\";</font>. <p>
 
<hr> <p>
 
Simulate the model from 1900 until 2100, and display the same variables as in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/193149858X\">Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</a> at page 245: <p>

This seems to have done the trick.  The population no longer declines during the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  Is this effort sustainable? <p>
 
To answer this question, let us simulate the model once more, this time from 1900 until 2500: <p>
<img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/World3_31.png\"> <p>
<img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/World3_32.png\"> <p>
<img src=\"modelica://SystemDynamics/Resources/Images/World3_33.png\"> <p>
 
<hr> <p>
 
The effort is not sustainable in the long run.  As we continue to produce industrial goods in order to maintain a high standard of living, we continue to use up the non-recoverable resources, albeit at a much slower rate.  Eventually, these resources get exhausted, and at that time, we return to a life in misery. <p>

In the long run, the predicament is the same as with <font color=red><b>Scenario #9</b></font>.  We are running out of the remaining non-recoverable resources.  Yet, the golden age would have lasted a bit longer. <p>

This model implements <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Meadows\">Dennis (and Dana) Meadows'</a> <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model as described in their 1972 book <i>Limits to Growth: A Report for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind</i>.  The book has seen two later editions, one published in 1992 (20-year edition), and the most recent one published in 2004 (30-year edition).  Each of these new editions was accompanied by an updated model.  The model contained in this library is the newest model discussed in the 2004 edition <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/193149858X\">Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</a>.  <p>
 
Whereas Jay Forrester listed his entire model in his book \"World Dynamics,\" Dennis Meadows only talked in \"Limits to Growth\" about the results obtained using his model.  The model itself is not listed. <p>
 
This was partly done because the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model is considerably more complex than the <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model, and consequently, a thorough discussion of all facets of the model would have eaten up much more space in the book, but there is another reason as well. <p>
 
Stephen Hawking wrote in the introduction to one of his more popular books (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Time-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0553380168\">A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes</a>) that he had asked his publisher whether he could include some equations with the book.  The publisher answered that he would print anything that Stephen Hawking cared to submit for publication, but that the number of books sold would shrink by a facter of two for every added equation.  Hence Hawking decided to refrain from placing <i>any</i> equations in his book. <p>
 
Meadows is an <i>educator</i> even more than a <i>scientist</i>.  He believes strongly in his message, and he wanted to reach as many people with it as he possibly could.  Leaving the model equations out was the best way of accomplishing this goal. <p>
 
Yet, Meadows never tried to hide his model from public scrutiny.  In fact, he wrote an internal report of 637 pages that describes all facets of his model.  He published that internal report as a separate book in 1974: <a href=\"http://www.pegasuscom.com/BookDetail.asp?BookQuery_Action=Find('ISBN','XDYGO')\">Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World</a>.  The book is still available if anyone cares to buy it.  However, whereas Meadows sold millions of copies of his (popular) <i>Limits to Growth</i> book, he probably sold no more than a few hundred copies of his (technical) <i>Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World</i> report. <p>
 
Since the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model is fairly complex, it won't fit on a single screen.  For this reason, I subdivided the model into 13 different sectors (i.e., sub-models) describing some aspects of: <br>
 
<ol>
<li> arable land dynamics,
<li> food production,
<li> <a href=\"http://www.footprintnetwork.org/gfn_sub.php?content=whoweare\">Mathis Wackernagel's</a> <a href=\"http://www.footprintnetwork.org/gfn_sub.php?content=footprint_overview\">human ecological footprint</a>,
<li>human fertility,
<li><a href=\"http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0004-5608(198812)78%3A4%3C580%3AWVIHWA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-A\">human welfare index</a>,
<li>industrial investment,
<li>labor utilization,
<li>land fertility,
<li>life expectancy,
<li>non-recoverable resource utilization,
<li>pollution dynamics,
<li>population dynamics, and
<li>service-sector investment.
</ol> <p>
 
The sub-models use green icons.  In the main model (yellow icon), I simply dropped one sub-model of each type onto the screen, and connected these models appropriately. <p>
 
Whereas the <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model lumped the entire population into a single state variable, the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model offers a demographic population dynamics model that distinguishes between children and adolescents, young adults of child-bearing age, older adults who are still integrated into the work force, and the retired population. <p>
 
The capital investment is subdivided into investments in the military/industrial complex, in the service sector, and in agriculture. <p>
 
Both the natural resources and pollution models have been upgraded by including changes in technology as factors influencing the depletion of resources and the release of pollutants.  This is meaningful as improved technology may enable us to use the available resources more efficiently, and may also make it possible to produce goods in a cleaner fashion. <p>
 
The over-all (compiled) <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model contains 41 state variables and 245 algebraic variables. <p>
 
At this time, all that remains is to thank <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Meadows\">Prof. Meadows</a> for his support of my efforts.  Dennis was kind enough to send me his complete <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model (2004 edition, coded in <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font>) on a CD.  All that I had to do was to translate the model, equation by equation, from <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font> to <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font>. <p>
 
Unfortunately, <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font> doesn't offer means for documenting models in an explicit way.  There was not a single line of comments in the entire model.  Meadows compensated for this lack of documentability by choosing very long variable names.  These helped tremendously in deciphering the meaning of the model.  I hope I didn't goof up too badly in doing so. <p>
 
In order to make it as easy as possible to compare the <font color=red><b>Modelica</b></font> version of the <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model with the <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font>-coded original, I decided to keep the same variable names in my model that Dennis had chosen for his version. <p>
 
I also wish to acknowledge <a href=\"http://www.bi.no/Content/AcademicProfile____63388.aspx?ansattid=/fgl99096\">Prof. J�rgen Randers</a> who provided me with the information necessary to reproduce the 10 scenarios proposed in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/193149858X\">Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update</a>. <p>

This package offers currently two different world models: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester\">Jay Forrester's</a> <font color=red><b>WORLD2</b></font> model (1971), and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Meadows\">Dennis (and Dana) Meadows'</a> <font color=red><b>WORLD3</b></font> model (1972), the latter in its most recently updated form of 2004. <p>
 
World modeling is one of the most important applications of the System Dynamics methodology.  This application, highly popular in the 1970s, has recently found renewed interest due to the widely discussed advents of <font color=red><b>Peak Oil</b></font> and <font color=red><b>Global Warming</b></font>. <p>

You shall notice that the limit cycle is mildly unstable. <p>
 
The simulation results obtained are not exactly the same as with <font color=red><b>SystemDynamics 1.0</b></font>.  The reason is that the previous version used tabular interpolation functions with linear extrapolation, whereas the new version uses tabular interpolation functions without extrapolation capability (a more prudent approach).  In line with <font color=red><b>STELLA</b></font> philosophy, the support values of the two tabular functions were manually extended to reflect a <i>constant</i> rather than a <i>linear</i> extrapolation.

Two separate and independent versions of this library had originally been created by <a href=\"http://www.promasim.com/\">Dr. Stefan Fabricius</a> and by <a href=\"http://www.inf.ethz.ch/~fcellier/\">Prof. Fran&ccedil;ois Cellier</a> and his students.  These have now been merged into a single version that has furthermore been enhanced as well.</p>
<p>System Dynamics offers a fairly low-level graphical interface, not much different from a block diagram.  The fact that continuous systems contain differential equations is hidden from the user by talking about <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>levels</strong></span>, i.e., quantities that can accumulate (state variables), and <span style=\"color: red;\"><strong>rates</strong></span>, i.e., quantities that influence the accumulation and/or depletion of levels (state derivatives).</p>
<p>The System Dynamics modeling metaphor is widely used especially by researchers in the life sciences and social sciences.</p>
