# SystemDynamics
Free library for modeling according to the principles of system dynamics of J. Forrester.

## Library description

The SystemDynamics library allows to model according to the principles of system dynamics originated by J.W. Forrester in the 1960's. The field of system dynamics is not new and well established, hence, the novelty and value of this library is not to be seen in the modeling principles of system dynamics themselves, rather, in the combination of system dynamics modeling with the vast object-oriented, multi-formalism, physical modeling capabilities of Modelica.

System dynamics is widespread mainly in economics, management, biology and environmental areas. The SystemDynamics Modelica library paves the way for integrated treatment of socio-technical systems, having both continuous-time and discrete-event aspects. In addition, it is thought valuable to be able to use the System Dynamics modeling concept, which supports the "top-down" modeling approach, together with the inherent "bottom-up" approach of physical object-oriented modeling.

The documentation is included in the source code package.

#### Release notes
* [Version v2.1.2 (2023-02-07)](../../archive/v2.1.2.zip)
  * `SystemDynamics 2.1.2` is a release that updates the library to work with MSL 4.0.0.
* [Version v2.1.1 (2020-01-13)](../../archive/v2.1.1.zip)
  * `SystemDynamics 2.1.1` is a bugfix release only to fix some annotations and illegaly used characters. It was at the same time updated to work with MSL 3.2.3. The license was changed (in agreement with the copyright holders) to 3-Clause BSD License.
* [Version v2.1 (2013-10-16)](../../archive/v2.1.zip)
  * `SystemDynamics 2.1` is based on SystemDynamics Version 2.0 that was developed by Prof. Cellier and his students, and has been primarily updated in order for it to work with MSL 3.2.1. The diagrams have been corrected from the old graphical definitions and some icons have been added.
* [Version v2.0 (2007-09-13)](../../archive/v2.0.zip)
  * `SystemDynamics 2.0` constitutes a completely reworked release of the SystemDynamics library. This version is based in part on Version 1.0, and in part on a different and independently created version of a System Dynamics library for Dymola/Modelica, a version that had been developed by Prof. Cellier and his students at the University of Arizona, and had been around in a much reduced form since 2001.
* Version v1.0 (2002-04-09)
  * `SystemDynamics 1.0` constituted the first official release of the SystemDynamics library. That version was created by Stefan Fabricius in 2002, at a time when Stefan worked as a Ph.D. student at ETH Zurich.
